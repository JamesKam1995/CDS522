# CDS522
Text and Speech Analytics (USM)

It is a project done under the CDS522 Text and Speech during my master period.

CDS 522 Project EDA is the exploratory data analysis of the dataset. while CDS522 Text Classification is a file for text classification reult using logistic regression, SVM and naive bayes. 

The data is abstracted from BBC News Summary: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pariza/bbc-news-summary 

The objectives of the project is listed as below: 
1. Select the best classifier
2. study the effect of text preprocessing on the classifier performance (steming, lemmatization and stopwords removal)
3. study the effect of N-gram

The result shows that
1. Naive Bayes performs the best
2. Different pre-processing steps can result in either improvement or degradation in the classifier’s performance.
3. The classifier’s performance tends to degrade as the N-gram order goes higher due to the data sparsity

The report CDS_522_Project_Report is the report prepared for this assignment
